# Proposal: give sites the ability to invalidate documents in BFCache or prerendering when cookies or storage keys change

## Context

This proposal is a piece of a larger proposal
to safely enable BFCaching of pages
with the `Cache-Control: no-store` (_CCNS_) header.
For full details on that,
see the accompanying [explainer][ccns-explainer].

It is also motivated by concerns
about leaking sensitive information when prerendering pages.

## Terminology

Conventionally,
when talking about pages in BFCache,
the term "eviction" is used
to mean that the page is removed from the cache
and will never be restored.
Conventionally,
when talking about prerendering,
the term "cancellation" if used
to mean that the browser stops the prerendering process
discards the results
which are never presented to the user.
In both cases,
the essence is that an inactive document
is prevented from ever becoming active
and being presented to the user.

In this document,
we will talk about "invalidation" of inactive documents
to cover both eviction from BFCache
and cancellation of prerendering.

## Overview

We propose to add an API that allows
the top-level document in a page to declare
that it must be invalidated
(evicted from BFCache or prerendering cancelled)
if certain cookies or storage keys change while it is in inactive.

For example, the following JS snippet
will cause the document, if inactive,
to be invalidated
if the 'SID' cookie changes,

```js
inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setCookie(['SID']);
```

Similarly, the following JS snippet
will cause the document, if inactive,
to be invalidated
if the value of the key 'authToken' in session storage changes,

```js
inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setSessionStorage(['authToken']);
```

## Background

### BFCache

BFCache is a "cache" in browsers
such that when the user navigates away from a top-level document,
the browser may preserve that document in a frozen state
and if the user traverses history back to that document's history entry,
the browser may just unfreeze the preserved document.

This provides a significant performance boost
on these navigations
at the cost of not refreshing the content.
Depending on the nature of the content,
not refreshing the content may be harmless,
inconvenient or a serious problem
(e.g. the user has logged out
but the page still contains logged-in content).

[This web.dev article](https://web.dev/bfcache) has more information on BFCache.

### Prerendering

Prerendering is where the browser decides
that the user is likely to navigate to a URL
and (in the background) initiates the process of
fetching the URL and rendering the content.
If the user does actually navigate to that URL
the browser can present the renderered content instantly.

Similarly to BFCache,
a prerendered page is based on content
that was fetched some time in the past.
Similarly to BFCache,
this may be harmless
or it may be a serious problem.

[This web.dev article](https://web.dev/speculative-prerendering/) has more information on prerendering.

### Authorization

#### Secure cookies

Best practice for authorization has been,
for a long time,
to hold a token in an HTTPS-only cookie
so that all requests present this token.
Deleting this cookie deauthenticates the browser
and usually corresponds to a logout.
The same outcome applies when the cookie expires.
Replacing the cookie with a new value
might also correspond to a change in authorization state
or it may just be a refresh of the token
or other neutral change.

Conservatively, we can consider any change
to be a significant authorization change
even if it does not correspond to a logout.

#### Other cookies

Other non-auth or non-HTTPS-only cookies may also be significant to a page
e.g. representing contents of shopping carts.
Changes to these may also imply that inactive pages in BFCache or prerendering
have outdated/incorrect contents.

#### `Authorization` header and tokens

Authorization may also happen via 3rd parties,
resulting in tokens that are presented
via the `Authorization` header.
For example, federated sign-in
(sign-in with Google/Twitter/Facebook/etc)
provides a token that can then be presented on later RPCs.
There are sites that use this as their only form of authorization
(with no use of cookies).
Typically they are single-page apps since,
without cookies,
HTTP requests resulting from navigation
would be unauthenticated.

Best practice for tokens like this
is to write them to site-private storage,
e.g. LocalStorage, SessionStorage, IndexedDB.
The token is read from storage when attaching to each RPC.
This ensures that a logout occurring in another tab
or in the same tab but in unrelated code
will result in fully deauthenticating the user.

Any use of the `Authorization` header
indicates that the page is now probably displaying information
that could only be acquired with authorization.

## Problem we are solving

When a document is in BFCache or prerendering for some time
and is then made visible,
the contents of the document may be out of date
or worse, the document may contain sensitive information
that the current user should not have access to,
e.g. if a logout occurred while the document was in BFCache.

Our goal is to make it easy for sites to avoid these problems
while still allowing and maximising usage of BFCache and prerendering.

While this API is useful on its own,
it is also a key part of
[safely enabling BFCaching of pages
with the `Cache-Control: no-store` (_CCNS_) header][ccns-explainer].
CCNS is one of the largest blockers of BFCache usage
and unblocking it would provide a large performance benefit to users.

## Existing solutions

### Block BFCache

One simple solution is to prevent documents from being BFCached.
We know that some sites are using CCNS headers to do this
and [advice to do so][ccns-advice] can be found online.
BFCache is a significant performance win for users,
so completely preventing its use,
just in case
is an overly broad solution and hurts users.

### Respond to `pageshow` events

A more complicated solution
is to implement `pageshow` event handlers
that ensure that the document's contents are updated
when the document is restored from BFCache
or presented after prerendering.
This provides the best user experience
when the content is not privacy sensitive
but updating a site to do this is non-trivial.

## Proposed solution

Allow sites to declare that certain state changes
in cookies or storage
should cause the site's inactive documents to be invalidated.

When authorization state changes,
a site using cookies for authorization
will see a change in cookies.
A site using the `Authorization` header
should see a change in stored token(s).

Invalidating when cookies or storage changes strikes a balance
between impact and ergonomics for site developers.
Declaring a set of relevant cookies or storage keys is low overhead.
It ensures that stale documents are not presented to the user
after authorization state changes.

Invalidating when cookies change
causes a relatively low rate of invalidation.
Chrome's analysis shows that fewer than 50% of documents
currently blocked from BFCache by the CCNS header
have any cookie change within 3.5 minutes of entering BFCache.
Fewer than 5% have any [secure cookie][secure-cookie] change
in that time.

We do not have any statistics
on how often prerendering would be cancelled.

We do not have any statistics
on the frequency of changes to stored authorization tokens
since we cannot know which stored items
are authorization tokens.
We will measure how often the `Authorization` header
is seen on pages with CCNS
and what impact it would have
if we were to continue to block cacheing
of CCNS pages
when we see that header used.

### Interaction with CCNS header and BFCache

As mentioned above,
this API could be useful on its own.
However it is being proposed as part of a [broader proposal][ccns-explainer]
to allow BFCaching of documents with the CCNS header.
In that context,
use of this API would be taken as a signal
that a document with CCNS may enter BFCache.
This would allow sites to almost entirely eliminate CCNS blocking
while still ensuring that
documents are not restored after authorization state has changed.

## **API**

The API shape in this document is very much a straw person.
At this stage,
we are more interested in feedback about the fundamental idea
than about the specifics of the API (naming, shape etc).

The API presents a `inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals` object
which has methods for registering cookies and other storage mechanisms:

- setCookie
- setSessionStorage
- setLocalStorage
- setIndexedDB

For setCookie, setSessionStorage and setLocalStorage,
items to monitor for changes
are identified by a single key.
For setIndexedDB, a combination of database name and object store name
identify the item to be monitored.
It is unclear if this is sufficient for all uses of IndexedDB for token storage.
It assumes that tokens will be stored in a store dedicated to token storage.
If the store is also used for other data
then we will over-invalidate.

For example, the following JS snippet
will cause the document, if inactive,
to be invalidated if the SID cookie changes
or if there is a change to the 'tokens' store
in the 'auth' database of IndexedDB.

```js
inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setCookie(['SID']);
inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setIndexedDB([{'database': 'auth', 'object_store': 'tokens'}]);
```

### Details

When `inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.[some setter]` is called set to a list

* if a document is in BFCache or prerendering,
  the browser must monitor the listed cookies or keys
  (the list may be empty)
  and if any change occurs in those cookies,
  (modify/delete/expire),
  or storage keys (delete/set),
  the document should be invalidated.

When `setCookies` is not called
or called with `null` or `undefined` parameter.

* no cookie-based invalidation should occur.
* the browser can consider the API to _have not_ been used for cookies.

When none of the functions `setLocalStorage`, `setSessionStorage`, and `setIndexedDB` are called,
or are called with `null` or `undefined` parameter.

* no storage-based invalidation should occur.
* the browser can consider the API to _have not_ been used for tokens.

#### Top-level documents vs subframes

The API is only availble to top-level documents.
This is consistent with ignoring
CCNS headers of subframes with regard to BFCache.

We do not want to give cross-origin subframes
the power to cause invalidation.

If there is a demand and clear use-case
for making it available in same-origin subframes
then we should consider this.

### API Goals

While the API is a straw person, there are some specific goals:

* list 1 or more cookies/keys
* distinguish between the API having been used or not
* allow for an explicit signal that invalidation should not be triggered
  just because cookies/keys change
* avoid over-eviction

### API Non-goals

Provide a mechanism to unconditionally prevent documents from being BFCached.
There is [broad agreement ](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5744)
that we should not provide an API that simply prevents BFCaching
as this is too easy to overuse/use incorrectly.

### Key scenarios

#### **Scenario: Monitor cookies**

##### For BFCache
1. Site a.com uses a cookie named "SID" to store an auth token for logged-in users.
2. The user goes to a.com/foo.
3. This runs the following JS.

   ```js
   inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setCookie(['SID']);
   ```
4. The user navigates to a.com/bar.
5. The user logs out from a.com (no navigation occurs).
6. The user traverses back to a.com/foo.

This results in a.com/foo being evicted at step 5,
so step 6 is a fresh load of a.com/foo
instead of restoring a.com/foo as it was while logged in.

##### For Prerendering

1. Site a.com uses a cookie named "SID" to store an auth token for logged-in users.
2. The user goes to a.com/foo while logged in.
3. This prerenders a logged-in view of a.com/foo-page-2, which runs the following JS:

   ```js
   inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setCookie(['SID']);
   ```
4. The user opens a new tab to a.com/bar.
5. The user logs out of a.com in that new tab. This causes the prerendered copy of a.com/foo-page-2 held by the first tab to get discarded.
6. The user switches back to their first tab, which is displaying a.com/foo.
7. The user clicks a link to a.com/foo-page-2.

Because the prerender was discarded,
they correctly see a logged-out view of a.com/foo-page-2.

#### **Scenario: Behave as before with regard to BFCache**

This is the default state.
This is here for completeness
and to make it clear that there is a difference between ``null`` and ``[]``.
The distinction might be confusing.
We are open to suggestions for an alternative API
that captures the range of options we want to represent.

This use case makes sense
in the context of the [broader proposal][ccns-explainer]
to allow BFCaching of documents with the CCNS header.

```js
inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setCookie(null);
```

#### **Scenario: Explicitly monitor no cookies**

A document wants to signal
that it can remain in BFCache or prerendering
regardless of cookie changes.
This use case makes sense
in the context of the [broader proposal][ccns-explainer]
to allow BFCaching of documents with the CCNS header.

```js
inactiveDocumentController.invalidationSignals.setCookie([]);
```

#### **Scenario: Programmatic flushing of BFCache**

This may be considered an abuse of the API
but absent another API to more directly provide this,
we may see sites setting a cookie or other item
that serves no other purpose than to be a sentinel,
which, when altered,
causes BFCached documents from the site to be evicted.

#### **Possible Scenario: Match a class of cookies**

The API does not support this
and it's unclear that it's needed
(certainly in V1)
but a site may want to say something like,
"invalidate if any HTTPS-only cookies change"
or "invalidate if any cookies on this path change".

Until there is a clear use case,
this will remain just a note on a possible extension of the API.

## Considered alternatives

### Header

Sites could also specify the same information in an HTTP header.

The choice to use a JS API rather than a header is currently somewhat arbitrary.

* JS seems more flexible
  and avoids parsing and serialisation concerns if we make changes in the future.
* A header centralises control
  and prevents random JS libraries from altering BFCache+CCNS behaviour.

It may be that we would want both.
We will spend more time on this after validating the basic idea.

### Cookie Metadata

Instead of requiring pages to list the cookies which matter,
cookies could declare themselves to be significant.

This would mean that all pages of the site would be invalidated
when the cookies changes
without any code changes.
This is probably overly broad
but it makes it impossible to have a problem
whereby a page is forgotten.

### Manual Invalidation

Allow sites to invalidate their inactive documents,
e.g. `Clear-Site-Data: "cache"` (or adding a new value like `"bfcache"`)
or adding an explicit JS API.
An explicit API has been [discussed before](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5744).
This could solve the logout-while-cached problem,
however it has some downsides

* by giving an explicit API
  we risk over-use of that API.
  Our user research and discussions with some sites
  indicates that CCNS is often mis-understood and overused.
  If we provide another easy way to continue to do the same
  it may be used thoughtlessly.
  Until a blanket invalidation API is confirmed to be really needed for specific situations,
  it's preferable to leave the opportunity for the ecosystem
  to push back with concrete scenarios
  for the cases where the current proposal might not be enough in its current shape.
* it provides no signal that can be used to opt in to BFCacheing of CCNS pages
  and so, no CCNS pages could be BFCached until we implement the follow-on.
  This means that until the follow-on,
  this API would only increase invalidations.
  It also means that sites with CCNS pages
  cannot effectively trial it before the follow-on
  - their CCNS pages will not be cached.
* with the cookie API,
  sites can lower their invalidation rate by listing a small set of cookies,
  which will prevent over-invalidation in the follow-on
* pages that use the cookie API will see no change when the follow-on lands
* the cookie API is set-and-forget
  it does not require ensuring that every path that leads to a significant state change
  also clears BFCache

## Security considerations

This just adds another way for a document to be invalidated.
It's conceivable that a.com could decrease b.com's BFCache hit rate,
by causing b.com's cookies to change more frequently than normal.
E.g. by repeatedly navigating an iframe to a URL of b.com's
that changes cookies even without any user-interaction
(e.g. /logout).
b.com can mitigate this attack by
- listing specific cookies (as recommended)
- preventing embedding of URLs that change cookies without interaction
  (already a good idea)

## Privacy considerations

This gives no new information to sites.
If a document is invalidated due to this API
it means that a cookie for that site has been deleted/altered/expired.
It cannot discover that this happens
until the user returns to that page in a history traversal.
At that point the site can discover the state of all of its cookies.
